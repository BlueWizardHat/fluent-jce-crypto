A wrapper for Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) with a fluent syntax
=========================================================================

This small library implements a fluent style wrapper around Java's JCE
extension. Hopefully making it easy to implement encryption in Java
applications in a proper way.

Disclaimer: I am by no means an cryptography expert, I just saw a need
for a simpler API for the sometimes rather cryptic API that is part of
standard java.
